# Chat App (React Native Chat Application)

This project is designed to be a chat interface for mobile devices. It uses React Native as a framework and Google Firebase as a database to connect the application on multiple devices.

# Getting Started

+ Download repository from github

   See prerequisites if you do not have Expo installed already
+ Run command `expo install` in the repository
+ Download the Expo App on any mobile device

   Alternatively you can use any phone emulator capable of running the Expo Client

***

# Prerequisites

This app requires Expo and either a mobile device with the Expo App installed or an emulator capable of running the Expo App. To install Expo on your device go to your terminal and install expo-cli globally. Example:
```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

***

# Walk through

After everything is downloaded, cd into the project directory and run `expo install`. This will install all the dependencies onto your computer. No edits are needed for the application to run smoothly after install.
+ Run `expo start` to start the application.

After the application fully starts, a webpage running on a local host should populate. This page gives a log of all activities, any errors, as well as the left hand side allows for use of an emulator instead of a physical mobile device. If using a physical device, a QR code should populate under the emulator options. First, ensure your device is connected to the same network as your computer, they cannot communicate otherwise. Open the Expo App and scan the QR code. This will cause expo to create a build of the code. _This may take a while._ After the build is complete, your physical device will download the code and start the application.
